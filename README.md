# Doorbell Control Unit (Arduino)
An code for most any Arduino board out there, that allows the user to make a custom doorbell and (if so desired) add lights to the mix
for when the bell is turned off. A fun little DIY project, I would say. 
Hope you guys have some fun with my idea!

Below is a rough schematic of how to assemble it.
